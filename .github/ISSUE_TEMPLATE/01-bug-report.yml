        This is a developer bug tracker for packages of Termux on Google Play. If you are a user wanting to report an issue about Termux, please use [https://bugs.termux.net](https://bugs.termux.net/) instead.

        To submit a bug report, fill the form below. Provide as much as possible information about the encountered issue. We may request extended information such as `strace` logs if considered necessary. This will help package maintainers to understand the problem correctly and provide a solution. Make sure that your logs do not leak sensitive information (passwords, API keys, etc). Be patient, do not expect that issue could get resolved immediately.
